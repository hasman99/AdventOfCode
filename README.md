# AdventOfCode
This repo contains my solutions to the 'Advent of Code 2020' challenge: https://adventofcode.com.

The purpose of this for me is mostly just to gain familiarity with git. 

Since there is no way I'm getting up at 05:00, competing for speed is pointless. I'll thus aim to produce the most efficient algorithms possible (with respect to long run time complexity).

Throughout all sorts are assumed to take place in O(nlogn) time and all dictoinary lookups are assumed to be O(1).

All code will be written in Python 3.8.2.
